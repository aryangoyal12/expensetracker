The purpose of the Expense Tracker is to facilitate University hostellers to maintain detail log of all their expenditures and give them an insight into their spending behaviour. This will help them inculcate the culture of maintaining financial discipline. Therefore, they will learn to make informed decisions and manage their accounts in a responsible way.

The Expense Tracker is intended to be used by all University Students, especially those who reside in hostels and must manage their finances on their own, without any direct supervision form their guardians.

This Project will help students learn to construct a better perspective about money and will help them gain a better understanding of the psychology that governs its functionality. This is especially crucial when it comes to shaping the upcoming torch bearers and decision makers, design the trajectory of their Investing behaviour. This will also allow the developers of this project to learn to use various specialized tools and equipment and acquire valuable knowledge on developing quality software products.


The Expense Tracker allows users to set limits to the amount of money they are going to spend within a specific period. This period is also mentioned and fed into the system by the user. To generate the warning about the user approaching that limit, the total available sum is also required to be mentioned.

The users are needed to understand the basics of software handling. Since, the outline of the software is rudimentary, the basics of computing must be known to the user. Also, University Students should comprise this class of users.

Multiple users cannot access the system. This is simply because the user is not provided the functionality to create a separate account to access the system. The lack of a database inhibits the user tounderstand his/her spending record over a longer duration of time. However, file-based storage is employed to access these records for a limited duration. There is no way to readily get the amount spent after each transaction.


The Expense Tracker computes the average daily expenses based on the amount deducted from the total available sum. This, along with tracking of daily expenses, is a powerful tool to facilitate the users to track their exact spending behaviour. This average is calculated based on the average duration of time the expenses are being tracked for. This is done to ensure that there is no discrepancy in the data being returned.

The tracker should generate warning to let the user know that the limit has been reached. The Tracker should further suggest how much money the user can cut back on to get back to a stable situation. This allows the user to understand the degree of seriousness that must be exercised in order to prevent a total exhaustion of all resources.

The product is required to behave the same way, to an acceptable degree, over continuous usage, in the same operating environment. It is expected to avoid crashing and prevent user frustration. Thus, the software is expected to be reliable. This is ensured through relevant Exception Handling. It is also required to recover from error or unexpected input. There must be provision for large data handling. All in all, the software must be robust. Thus, much focus is given to improve the optimization of the code.

To bolster dependability, the software is required to avoid causing physical and/or economic damage in the events of system failure. This is ensured largely by the fact that the system will avail the mostbasic elements of software-user interactions.

Malicious users must not be able to access or damage the system. This is especially important to protect the files that will store the details of every transaction and the spending history.

Accurate results must be provided to the user. The start and end date should not be manipulated. Available funds should not be altered.

System should generate warnings as soon as the limit is reached to achieve the basic objective the Expense Tracker.

The system will generate warnings when the userâ€™s expenditures exceed the limit set by the user, before the tracking begins.
